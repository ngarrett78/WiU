        <p class="description">My name is Nate Garrett and two years ago I was working in the insurance industry and miserable. After six years of helping insurance agents grow their business and teaching them about index annuities, I decided I had enough. One constant I noticed with insurance agents throughout the country was that they all had terrible websites. I picked up a book on HTML and CSS and so began my web designing career. At first, I was just helping friends and family design their websites for basically pennies. They still got ripped off. I was horrible at it. But like anything you stick with, I kept at it and got better. My skills got better and so did my business. Nonetheless, I knew I had gone as far as I could being self-taught. It was time for professionals to teach me the skills necessary to reach a professional status. I looked around for the schools that offered top-notch education along with the flexibility to still run my business. That's how, at thirty six years old, I became a student once again.   </p>
        <p>My time at Full Sail so far, has been challenging, rewarding and very educational. I’ve learned more about design and development in these first eleven months than I have over the last two years. This class on Interface & Usability is a perfect example of a topic that I didn’t even know I needed to learn and which is essential in designing websites. I’m excited about my future and feel great about my decision to continue my education. </p>
        <p>The links below will contain my future wireframes’ for this class. I’m looking forward to seeing my growth over this month as I’m still very new to Illustrator and design in general. </p>
